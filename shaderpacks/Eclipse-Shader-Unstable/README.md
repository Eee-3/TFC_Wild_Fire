# Eclipse - A Bliss Edit

Bliss is already one of the best and most feature rich shaders out there, yet I still wanted more...  
It started out with smaller features, but then the additions just kept piling up.

Notable changes/additions compared to Bliss unstable:
 + Custom moon orbit with possible eclipses
 + Water wave simulation for the player
 + Shader Grass
 + Aurora & Rainbow
 + Handheld shadows
 + Additional cirrus & cumulonimbus cloud layers (WIP)
 + Distant Horizons chunk fading
 + Moon Texture with phases
 + Snow Overlay and Rain Ripples
 + Better mod support
 + Better shader-side (hardcoded) emissives
 + Lightsource with shadows on the main end island
 + Rain & thunder cloud coverage and daily weather
 + Better lightning strikes with clouds lighting up and shadows
 + Voxy, Colorwheel, Caelum (Arda Craft) support
 + Emissive Ores

Note: With default settings there is at least one guaranteed eclipse per ingame year.

## Eclipses <sub>(why else would I call the shader Eclipse??)</sub>
